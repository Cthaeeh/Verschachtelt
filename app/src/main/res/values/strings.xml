			<p>
				To decide on a move, the AI looks at all its available possibilities and what move the human player could play in response. And then again the AI searches for a next own move ... and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, the AI looks moves ahead, just like humans do. The playing ability is determined by the number of moves the computer looks ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its ability to look hundreds of thousands moves ahead, to find a good continuation in an acceptable time, the AI tries to investigate the more likely moves first and might ignore others after finding a very good one before.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technique is called Alphaâ€“beta pruning and is used by most chess programs. The better the moves are sorted into likely and unlikely ones, the better it works. Therefore captures have a higher priority than quiet moves.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finding a series of likely moves, the AI evaluates the board, to see how good the outcome was. Material weight, positions, the pawn structure, and the king safety come into account.
